<p> A long time ago, in a continent far far away, I was travelling around Australia with two friends when
I decided to go my own way and take a sailing trip around the Whitsunday Islands. It wasn’t that we’d fallen
out, but one had to work in Sydney and the other had a flight to catch,
and I was determined not to let their plans stop me from seeing everything the Gold Coast had to offer. </p>
